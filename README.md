# Research Based Learning for Simulation and Modelling of Physical Systems (FI3203)
This repository houses resources and code pertaining to the Research-Based Learning (RBL) course entitled "Simulation and Modeling of Physical Systems (FI3203)." Our team comprises the following individuals:
1. Riana Arsanda Putri (10221003)
2. Muhammad Afief Abdurrahman (10221006)
3. Ilham Ghufroni (10221012)
4. Zahra Auria (10221022)

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for simulation tasks and analysis.
- **src/**: Contains Python source code for simulation and modeling.
- **main.py**: The main script for executing simulations.
- **pyproject.toml**: Project metadata and dependencies configuration.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for the simulations and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization of the models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mafiefa02/rbl-fi3203.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rbl-fi3203
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage
1. Open `notebooks/simulation.ipynb` to explore and run different simulations.
2. Use `main.py` to run the primary simulation model by running `uv run main.py` within root directory.
